    """Compute Area Under the Curve (AUC) from prediction scores

    Note: this implementation is restricted to the binary classification task
    or multilabel classification task in label indicator format.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_classes]
        True binary labels in binary label indicators.

    y_score : array, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_classes]
        Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
        class, confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions
        (as returned by "decision_function" on some classifiers).

    average : string, [None, 'micro', 'macro' (default), 'samples', 'weighted']
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise,
        this determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by considering each element of the label
            indicator matrix as a label.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label).
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape = [n_samples], optional
        Sample weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array, shape = [n_samples]
        True binary labels in range {0, 1} or {-1, 1}.  If labels are not
        binary, pos_label should be explicitly given.

    y_score : array, shape = [n_samples]
        Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
        class, confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions
        (as returned by "decision_function" on some classifiers).

    pos_label : int or str, default=None
        Label considered as positive and others are considered negative.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape = [n_samples], optional
        Sample weights.

    drop_intermediate : boolean, optional (default=True)
        Whether to drop some suboptimal thresholds which would not appear
        on a plotted ROC curve. This is useful in order to create lighter
        ROC curves.

    Returns
    -------
    fpr : array, shape = [>2]
        Increasing false positive rates such that element i is the false
        positive rate of predictions with score >= thresholds[i].

    tpr : array, shape = [>2]
        Increasing true positive rates such that element i is the true
        positive rate of predictions with score >= thresholds[i].

    thresholds : array, shape = [n_thresholds]
        Decreasing thresholds on the decision function used to compute
        fpr and tpr. `thresholds[0]` represents no instances being predicted
        and is arbitrarily set to `max(y_score) + 1`.

    --------

    Notes
    -----
    Since the thresholds are sorted from low to high values, they
    are reversed upon returning them to ensure they correspond to both ``fpr``
    and ``tpr``, which are sorted in reversed order during their calculation.
